#installation

After you have installed python you will need to download a few python
libraries to sucessfully run the download_videos.py file. Open powershell/cmd (windows)
or terminal (linux) in the directory that has the download_videos.py and requirements.txt files.
After this type 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' and hit enter. This will install the
needed libraries. After this you will be able to run download_videos.py.  

When you run this script it will download ALL videos from r/combatfootage in same directory as the python script. 
Files will be named by the reddit post ID. In order to go to the original reddit post enter reddit.it/*insert post ID* 
from filename into browser without the * .
