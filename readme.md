#installation

After you have installed python you will need to download a few python
libraries to sucessfully run the download_videos.py file. Open powershell/cmd (windows)
or terminal (linux) in the directory that has the download_videos.py and requirements.txt files.
After this type 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' and hit enter. This will install the
needed libraries. After this you will be able to run download_videos.py.  

When you run this script it will download ALL videos from r/combatfootage into the downloads folder and into
a folder that is named for each post ID. Videos will be named by the reddit post ID. If you want to go to the
original post, open the the txt file and use the URL that was generated from the post ID.
